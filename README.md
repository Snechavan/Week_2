# Multi-Class Animal Classification

This project demonstrates how to classify images of 90 different animal species using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is based on the pre-trained MobileNetV2 architecture, which is fine-tuned to classify 90 animal species.

## Dataset Overview
- **Number of classes**: 90 different animal species.
- **Number of images**: Approximately 5400 images (4860 for training, 540 for validation).
- **Image Dimensions**: The images are resized to 224x224 pixels for model training.

## Animal Classes
The dataset consists of 90 animal species, with each species representing a unique class. The animals span a variety of groups, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects.
